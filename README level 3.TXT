LEVEL YOU WISH THE MINI-PROJECT TO BE MARKED FOR: 3

Now complete the statements below for each level you wish to be marked. Replace all text in square brackets.

LEVEL ONE

My code demonstrates inheritance in the following way...

I have a superclass called [Insert name of superclass here]

This superclass is extended into at least three subclasses called [Insert names of the subclasses here]

For each of the named subclasses complete the following...

Subclass 1.

Subclass [Insert name of subclass] extends the superclass by adding at least one property and its getters and setters. The name(s) of the added properties are [Insert names of properties here.]

These/this new properties/property are used by the subclass in the following way: [Insert justification for adding the property and give the line numbers in the code of where the property is used.]

Subclass [Insert name of subclass] extends the superclass by overriding the following methods (there must be at least one): [Insert names of overridden methods and their line numbers in the code.]

These overridden methods are used in the working code in the following places: [list the file names and line numbers where the overridden methods are called.]

Subclass 2.

Subclass [Insert name of subclass] extends the superclass by adding at least one property and its getters and setters. The name(s) of the added properties are [Insert names of properties here.]

These/this new properties/property are used by the subclass in the following way: [Insert justification for adding the property and give the line numbers in the code of where the property is used.]

Subclass [Insert name of subclass] extends the superclass by overriding the following methods (there must be at least one): [Insert names of overridden methods and their line numbers in the code.]

These overridden methods are used in the working code in the following places: [list the file names and line numbers where the overridden methods are called.]

Subclass 3.

Subclass [Insert name of subclass] extends the superclass by adding at least one property and its getters and setters. The name(s) of the added properties are [Insert names of properties here.]

These/this new properties/property are used by the subclass in the following way: [Insert justification for adding the property and give the line numbers in the code of where the property is used.]

Subclass [Insert name of subclass] extends the superclass by overriding the following methods (there must be at least one): [Insert names of overridden methods and their line numbers in the code.]

These overridden methods are used in the working code in the following places: [list the file names and line numbers where the overridden methods are called.]

[If you have more than three subclasses you want to tell us about, copy and paste the above text for as many subclasses as you want.]

LEVEL TWO

[In no more than three sentences and in your own words, define polymorphism.]

[List the places in your code where polymorphism is implemented, listing file names and line numbers.]

[Explain briefly (no more than four sentences), why polymorphism is necessary in your code.]

LEVEL THREE

[there are 4 buttons: save, load, attack and heal. All the buttons are found in the Window Class, line 39, 40, 41, 42. When the buttons are clicked they
execute the method at line 161 of Window class. the save button saves the status of the characters, load button loads the status of the characters.
attack button updates the textbox and heal button heals the ninja]

[ i have used exception handling in the Character class, at line 34 and at class SaveLoadGame at line 11 and line38.]  



[ArrayList of type bufferedImage is used to hold the images of the characters and it is called at all times. it is used in the Character class at lines,
 41, 49 ,54]


[the file I/O is implemented in the SaveLoadGame class. it uses bufferedreader to read a text file and transfer the data over to the character objects.
 it also uses buffered writer, which grabs the value of the character statuses and stores it in the text file. ]


ANYTHING ELSE

[ each time the user starts up the window, a new game is automatically started but, they can press the load button to start up their loaded save state.
